  "title": "Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations - 50 Percent",
  "description": "This is a variation of the Atmospheric CO2 Concentrationsdataset. In this variation, 50% of the latest epochs from the original timeseries are retained. The Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations dataset comprises measurements of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, expressed in parts per million (ppm). The data spans from March 1958 onwards, providing a long-term record of one of the greenhouse gases affecting Earth's climate. The dataset's monthly resolution allows for observing seasonal variations and long-term trends in CO2 concentrations. Sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Global Monitoring Laboratory, this dataset is a valuable resource in climate change research and environmental studies.",
